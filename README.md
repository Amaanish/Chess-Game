#  Chess Game in C++ with Stockfish Integration

A console-based chess game developed in **C++**, designed to deepen understanding of core programming concepts and system-level development. This project integrates the **Stockfish** chess engine to enhance gameplay and AI capabilities.

---

##  Features

- **Console-based gameplay** with a text-based interface
- **Move validation** to prevent illegal moves
- **Modular codebase** for easy maintenance and expansion

---

##  Installation

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have `g++` installed.
- **SFML Library**: Required for handling graphics and windowing.

I have used GNU compiler and SFML Library so installing those are a must for this to work.

## How to Install GNU and SFML
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++
sudo apt install libsfml-dev
```
