After recently learning C++ and finding it both powerful and fun, I decided to challenge myself by building a complete project â€” a console-based Chess game. This project was a great way to dive deeper into core programming concepts while also exploring the process of compiling and linking C++ programs using the GNU Compiler (g++).

This project is also a work in progress, I need to implement stockfish into the game and preventing the user to do illegal moves in the game.

I have used GNU compiler and SFML Library so installing those are a must for this to work.



```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++
sudo apt install libsfml-dev
```
